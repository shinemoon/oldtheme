<strong><span style="font-size: large">这</span></strong>几天，村上春树在耶路撒冷奖的颁奖礼上的演讲，似乎成了很多媒体的焦点。纵观全文，态度鲜明，能有这样的演讲，要佩服村上的直率，也更要佩服以色列政府的大度。<br /><br />演讲不长，观点也很明晰，简单，关于制度和个体的思考。也许不够厚重，并非“我在美丽的日本”，或者“我在暧昧的日本”那样级别的演讲文，但是足可见其性情。<br /><br />村上对于社会、现实的思考是越来越多了，其作品表现同样如此。<br /><h2>译文（根据原文，随手译就）</h2><br />晚上好。<br /><br />今天我是作为一名小说家来到耶路撒冷，而所谓小说家，素来就被认为是专业的谎言编织者。<br /><br />当然，会说谎话的绝不仅仅只有小说家。众所周知，政治家也擅长这个。还有，视具体情况，外交官和将军们也会要说特定的谎话。还有汽车销售员，屠夫以 及建筑商们也都不例外。但是，小说家的谎言和他们的谎言还是有所不同的——没人会认为小说家的谎言是不道德的事情。事实上，对于小说家来说，他们创造的谎 话越大、越逼真、越精巧，反而会因此获得公众和评论家的赞誉。事情何以至此？<br /><br />在我看来，原因应当是：通过讲述精巧的谎言——或者说，通过创造看上去真实的小说——小说家能够从中提炼出可以称之为真实的东西，并且让它彰显于世 间。在大部分情况下，想从现实当中捕捉到真实，并且精准的描述，实际上是不可能做到的事情。而这恰恰就是为什么我们要煞费苦心的把真实从深藏之所引导出 来，再把它诉诸于小说这种形式，并且最终试图揪住它的尾巴。但是，为了达到这样的目的，我们首先必须要搞清楚，所谓真实，究竟存在于我们身边的何处？究竟 存在于我们自身的何处？而这，其实是想要编造出好的谎言的一个重要条件。<br /><br />但是今天，我却无意撒谎。我会尽我所能的真诚。一年中只有少数的日子，我是不用‘说谎’的，而今天无疑就是其中之一。<br /><br />那么，就让我来告诉你们事实。在日本，有相当多的人，建议我不要来此接受耶路撒冷奖。甚至还有一些人警告我说，一旦我来了，他们将发起对我的作品的抵制活动。而究其原因，当然就是正在加沙发生的激烈的战争了。根据联合国的报道，就在被封锁的加沙，有超过一千的牺牲者，其中许多都是手无寸铁的平民——包括孩子和老人。<br /><br />在得到获奖的通知之后，我多次的问自己，在这样一个特殊时刻，前往以色列，并且接受这个文学奖，到底是不是一件正确的事情？这样的举动会不会造成这 样一种印象，即，我是在对处于冲突中的某一方表示支持，我赞同这个选择了将问题诉诸于武力解决的国家的政策。当然，事实绝非如此，同时，我自然也不乐见自 己的作品被抵制。<br /><br />但是，经过仔细的考虑，我最终决定来到了这里。一个重要的原因就是，太多人不赞同我这样做。而我，或许就和很多其他的小说家一样，总是倾向于去做那 些被告知‘不要去做’的事情。如果别人对我说——特别是，如果当他们‘警告’我时——“不要去那里，”“不要那样做，”，我总是倾向于“去那里”并且“那 样做”。你可以说，这是我作为小说家的天性。<br /><br />小说家是一个特别的品种。他们无法真正的相信任何未经亲眼所见或亲手碰触过的‘事实’。<br /><br />而这就是我身在此处的原因。我选择了来到这里，而不是远远的置身事外；我选择了亲眼来见证，而不是眼不见为净；我选择了将我所想的告诉给你们，而不是保持沉默。<br /><br />请允许我来传达一个信息，一个非常个人的信息。而它是我在写作小说时，心里常常在思考的东西。但是我从来未曾更进一步的把它写下来，或者试图把它贴在墙上作为箴言：因为，它其实早已深深刻在了我的心里，勉强要表达出来的话，那就是：<br /><br />“倘若要我在一面高大、坚固的墙和一个砸向这面墙的蛋之间做选择，我会始终站在蛋的这边。”<br /><br />的确，无论这堵墙是多么的正确，也无论这个蛋是多么的错误，我都会始终站在蛋的这边。<br /><br />换作他人，也许必须要就谁对谁错做一个结论；也许时间或者历史最终也会做出这样的判断。但是如果一个小说家——不论其出于任何理由——去撰写支持墙的作品，这样的作品，到底有什么样的价值呢？<br /><br />这是什么意思呢？在某些情况下，是非常简单和清楚的。炸弹、坦克、火箭弹以及白磷弹，这些就是那堵高墙。而那些手无寸铁的，被碾压、焚烧、射击的平民，就是那些蛋。这就是这个隐喻的涵义之一。<br /><br />但是，这不是全部。它有着更深一层的意义。让我们这样设想吧。我们中的每一个人，多多少少，都只算是一只蛋。我们中的每一个人，都有着被脆弱的表壳 所包裹的独一无二、不可替代的灵魂。我个人如此，对每个人皆然。而我们中的每个人，或多或少，都正在和一堵高大坚固的墙冲突着。这堵墙有一个名字：它叫做 “制度”。制度应当要保护我们的权益，但是有时候，它会有属于自己的生命，并且开始杀害我们以及迫使我们去杀害别人——无情的、高效的，以及有系统的。<br /><br />我创作小说唯一的目的是：展现个体灵魂的尊严，并使其得以沐浴光辉。而故事的目的就在于敲响警钟，用来防止我们的灵魂被彻底搅入制度的巨网，并且彻 底失色。我发自内心的相信，小说家的责任就在于利用他们的小说，通过那些关于生命和死亡的故事、那些关于爱的故事、那些让人们恐惧战栗、让人们放声大笑的 故事，来使人们了解，并且尊重个体的唯一性。<br /><br />而这就是身为小说家的我们，能够日复一日的，用异常认真的态度来锻造小说的原因。<br /><br />我的父亲去年去世了，享年90岁。他是一个退休教师，同时也是一名‘兼职僧人’。当他在京都的研究生院时，被征召入伍并且送到了中国战场。作为一个 战后出生的孩子，我已经习惯了在每天早饭前，看见他在家里小小的佛龛前做着长长的，虔诚的诵经。有一次，我问他为什么要这么做，而他告诉我，他是在为那些 死于战场的人祝祷，包括同伴和敌人。凝视着他佝偻在佛龛前的背影，我似乎能够看到盘旋在他身边的死亡的影子。<br /><br />我的父亲去世了，随他入土的还有那些属于他的记忆，那些我并不知晓的记忆。但是那潜伏在他身边的，死亡的存在却牢牢的留在我的心里。这是我从他身上学到的少数几样东西之一，并且也是最重要的一样。<br /><br />我今天只有一件希望向你们传达的事情。我们同属人类，无论国籍，种族以及宗教，而且，我们都是面对着那堵名为‘制度’的高墙的，外壳脆弱的蛋。<br /><br />从各种角度上讲，我们几乎都必败无疑。横亘面前的墙是如此之高，如此之强——又是如此的冷酷。可是，如果我们当真还存在着那么一丝丝胜利的希望的 话，那么这束希望必然就是建立在我们对自身和他人灵魂的绝对唯一性以及不可替代性的坚信之上，建立在我们通过紧紧连系我们的心灵，从而能够获得的温暖之 上。<br /><br />仔细想一想吧。我们中的每个人都有着确凿存在的，活生生的灵魂。所谓‘制度’并没有这样的东西。我们绝对不能容忍‘制度’来控制我们。我们绝对不能容忍‘制度’活转过来。不是‘制度’创造了我们：是我们创造了‘制度’。<br /><br />这就是所有我想说的。<br /><br />对于能够获得‘耶路撒冷奖’，我非常的感激。而我也很高兴，在世界各地，我的作品能够有如此多的读者。<br /><br />我也希望能够向以色列的读者表达我的感谢之情。你们是我能来到这里的最大的理由。我希望我们能够分享一些东西，一些非常有价值的东西。<br /><br />而我，则很高兴今天能有这样一个讲演的机会。<br /><br />非常感谢。<br /><h2>原文</h2><br />Good evening. I have come to Jerusalem today as a novelist, which is to say as a<br /><br />professional spinner of lies.<br /><br />Of course, novelists are not the only ones who tell lies. Politicians do it, too, as we all<br /><br />know. Diplomats and generals tell their own kinds of lies on occasion, as do used car<br /><br />salesmen, butchers and builders. The lies of novelists differ from others, however, in that<br /><br />no one criticizes the novelist as immoral for telling lies. Indeed, the bigger and better<br /><br />his lies and the more ingeniously he creates them, the more he is likely to be praised by<br /><br />the public and the critics. Why should that be?<br /><br />My answer would be this: namely, that by telling skilful lies--which is to say, by making up<br /><br />fictions that appear to be true--the novelist can bring a truth out to a new place and shine<br /><br />a new light on it. In most cases, it is virtually impossible to grasp a truth in its<br /><br />original form and depict it accurately. This is why we try to grab its tail by luring the<br /><br />truth from its hiding place, transferring it to a fictional location, and replacing it with<br /><br />a fictional form. In order to accomplish this, however, we first have to clarify where the<br /><br />truth-lies within us, within ourselves. This is an important qualification for making up<br /><br />good lies.<br /><br />Today, however, I have no intention of lying. I will try to be as honest as I can. There are<br /><br />only a few days in the year when I do not engage in telling lies, and today happens to be<br /><br />one of them.<br /><br />So let me tell you the truth. In Japan a fair number of people advised me not to come here<br /><br />to accept the Jerusalem Prize. Some even warned me they would instigate a boycott of my<br /><br />books if I came. The reason for this, of course, was the fierce fighting that was raging in<br /><br />Gaza. The U.N. reported that more than a thousand people had lost their lives in the<br /><br />blockaded city of Gaza, many of them unarmed citizens--children and old people.<br /><br />Any number of times after receiving notice of the award, I asked myself whether traveling to<br /><br />Israel at a time like this and accepting a literary prize was the proper thing to do,<br /><br />whether this would create the impression that I supported one side in the conflict, that I<br /><br />endorsed the policies of a nation that chose to unleash its overwhelming military power.<br /><br />Neither, of course, do I wish to see my books subjected to a boycott.<br /><br />Finally, however, after careful consideration, I made up my mind to come here. One reason<br /><br />for my decision was that all too many people advised me not to do it. Perhaps, like many<br /><br />other novelists, I tend to do the exact opposite of what I am told. If people are telling<br /><br />me-- and especially if they are warning me-- "Don&#039;t go there," "Don&#039;t do that," I tend<br /><br />to want to "go there" and "do that". It&#039;s in my nature, you might say, as a novelist.<br /><br />Novelists are a special breed. They cannot genuinely trust anything they have not seen with<br /><br />their own eyes or touched with their own hands.<br /><br />And that is why I am here. I chose to come here rather than stay away. I chose to see for<br /><br />myself rather than not to see. I chose to speak to you rather than to say nothing.<br /><br />Please do allow me to deliver a message, one very personal message. It is something that I<br /><br />always keep in mind while I am writing fiction. I have never gone so far as to write it on a<br /><br />piece of paper and paste it to the wall: rather, it is carved into the wall of my mind, and<br /><br />it goes something like this:<br /><br />"Between a high, solid wall and an egg that breaks against it, I will always stand on the<br /><br />side of the egg."<br /><br />Yes, no matter how right the wall may be and how wrong the egg, I will stand with the egg.<br /><br />Someone else will have to decide what is right and what is wrong; perhaps time or history<br /><br />will do it. But if there were a novelist who, for whatever reason, wrote works standing with<br /><br />the wall, of what value would such works be?<br /><br />What is the meaning of this metaphor? In some cases, it is all too simple and clear. Bombers<br /><br />and tanks and rockets and white phosphorus shells are that high wall. The eggs are the<br /><br />unarmed civilians who are crushed and burned and shot by them. This is one meaning of the<br /><br />metaphor.<br /><br />But this is not all. It carries a deeper meaning. Think of it this way. Each of us is, more<br /><br />or less, an egg. Each of us is a unique, irreplaceable soul enclosed in a fragile shell.<br /><br />This is true of me, and it is true of each of you. And each of us, to a greater or lesser<br /><br />degree, is confronting a high, solid wall. The wall has a name: it is "The System." The<br /><br />System is supposed to protect us, but sometimes it takes on a life of its own, and then it<br /><br />begins to kill us and cause us to kill others--coldly, efficiently, systematically.<br /><br />I have only one reason to write novels, and that is to bring the dignity of the individual<br /><br />soul to the surface and shine a light upon it. The purpose of a story is to sound an alarm,<br /><br />to keep a light trained on the System in order to prevent it from tangling our souls in its<br /><br />web and demeaning them. I truly believe it is the novelist&#039;s job to keep trying to clarify<br /><br />the uniqueness of each individual soul by writing stories--stories of life and death,<br /><br />stories of love, stories that make people cry and quake with fear and shake with laughter.<br /><br />This is why we go on, day after day, concocting fictions with utter seriousness.<br /><br />My father passed away last year at the age of ninety. He was a retired teacher and a part-<br /><br />time Buddhist priest. When he was in graduate school in Kyoto, he was drafted into the army<br /><br />and sent to fight in China. As a child born after the war, I used to see him every morning<br /><br />before breakfast offering up long, deeply-felt prayers at the small Buddhist altar in our<br /><br />house. One time I asked him why he did this, and he told me he was praying for the people<br /><br />who had died in the battlefield. He was praying for all the people who died, he said, both<br /><br />ally and enemy alike. Staring at his back as he knelt at the altar, I seemed to feel the<br /><br />shadow of death hovering around him.<br /><br />My father died, and with him he took his memories, memories that I can never know. But the<br /><br />presence of death that lurked about him remains in my own memory. It is one of the few<br /><br />things I carry on from him, and one of the most important.<br /><br />I have only one thing I hope to convey to you today. We are all human beings, individuals<br /><br />transcending nationality and race and religion, and we are all fragile eggs faced with a<br /><br />solid wall called The System. To all appearances, we have no hope of winning. The wall is<br /><br />too high, too strong--and too cold. If we have any hope of victory at all, it will have to<br /><br />come from our believing in the utter uniqueness and irreplaceability of our own and others&#039;<br /><br />souls and from our believing in the warmth we gain by joining souls together.<br /><br />Take a moment to think about this. Each of us possesses a tangible, living soul. The System<br /><br />has no such thing. We must not allow the System to exploit us. We must not allow the System<br /><br />to take on a life of its own. The System did not make us: we made the System.<br /><br />That is all I have to say to you.<br /><br />I am grateful to have been awarded the Jerusalem Prize. I am grateful that my books are<br /><br />being read by people in many parts of the world. And I would like to express my gratitude to<br /><br />the readers in Israel. You are the biggest reason why I am here. And I hope we are sharing<br /><br />something, something very meaningful. And I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak to<br /><br />you here today.<br /><br />Thank you very much.
